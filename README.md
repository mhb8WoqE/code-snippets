# About
This is little live templates for me to use in IntellijIdea while working on Minecraft mods and other projects.
Contains common code and useful classes but doesn't build them to separate libraries.
The whole point of this is when I need common code I just type a sequence in the editor and it completes into code chunk.
Fast and easy.

# Also
This is my first time trying to document my code and run tests. I hope I did decent.
